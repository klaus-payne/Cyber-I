                    Life Before USNA
                </h3>
                <p>
I was born and raised in Cologne, Minnesota on a very small farm. I grew up out
in the country, on a hobby farm of ten acres. I spent my childhood years working
in a cabinet making shop and logging, rather than playing peewee soccer or
watching Disney. I have never seen the Lion King or any of the classic Disney
Princess movies. These experiences lasted until I was ten, at which point I
moved to a different house in the country, this time in Michigan. However, many
of the things I enjoy (as seen in the interests page) I picked up while in
Minnesota.

I went on to a boarding military high school, Culver Military Academy. I was a
member of Charlie Company, Infantry Battalion for my four years. I graduated
after serving a Regimental Operations Officer and Company Commander of Charlie
Company. It is all simulated leadership, in a high school laboratory
environment, but it taught me an appreciation for proper use of excel, attentive
followers, and capable leaders.

A nice wrap up to this time period was my going away gift to my unit counselor,
a retired Army Sergeant Major.

This is a backlit shadow box made of red oak. The logo on the front is the
company insignia, the felted backdrop is over cork to display medals, and the
inside is illuminated.
