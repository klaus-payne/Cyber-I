                Life Before USNA
            </h3>
            <p>
I was born and raised in Cologne, Minnesota on a very small farm. I grew up out in the country, 
on a hobby farm of ten acres. I spent my childhood years working in a cabinet making shop and logging,
rather than playing peewee soccer or watching Disney. I have never seen the Lion King or any of the classic
Disney Princess movies. These experiences lasted until I was ten, at which point I moved to a different house
in the country, this time in Michigan. However, many of the things I enjoy (as seen in the interests page)
I picked up while in Minnesota.

I went on to a boarding military high school, Culver Military Academy. I was a member of Charlie Company,
Infantry Battalion for my four years. I graduated after serving a Regimental Operations Officer and Company 
Commander of Charlie Company. It is all simulated leadership, in a high school laboratory environment, but 
it taught me an appreciation for proper use of excel, attentive followers, and capable leaders.

A nice wrap up to this time period was my going away gift to my unit counselor, a retired Army Sergeant Major.
