	<h3>Its much less what interests me than what makes me interesting. Below I have listed some of my more notable achievements from pursuing my passions.</h3>

        1. I graduated high school - particularly I graduated from Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana. Its not a really orignal name, when you read it like that. However, the school was not named after the town in a brilliant stroke of unoriginal genius. The story is much more entertaining. Henry Harrison Culver founded the school in 1896. THis is, for any historians reading this, a long time ago. He had originally tried to build a hotel, but no one wanted to go spend their vacation time in the middle of the woods in Indiana. in, fact, no one does now either - sorry Indiana. so, realizing that no one would go there willingly and remembering that Terre Haute, IN, has dibs on the prisons, he chose the next best institution for <i>unwilling</i> inhabitants: a military school. Because of the sheer size of the school and the Culver family (The Culver family was vastly wealthy runing a cast iron stove company out of St. Louis already, and the school alternates between largest and second largest employer in its county), the town renamed itself from Marmont to Culver. When it was originally founded, in the early 1800's, it was called Uniontown. It was renamed Marmont after Auguste de Marmont, a marshall of Napoleon, and then Culver after the school. See, wasn't that more interesting than a school named after a town? <br>
        2. I have an old car. It is a 1968 Corvette corvette. Obviously, as a teenage boy, I love it more than life itself. I paid for it through a three pronged approach. The first prong was a found a crappy, well paying unskilled job. I worked as a farmhand for a local town. My emplying family heats their hosue through wood alone, to create independency for when civilization fails. I wish I was kidding. It takes about three <a href="http://www.woodheat.org/cord-wood.html"> cords</a> of wood to heat their house in the winter.
